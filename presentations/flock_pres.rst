About Me
========

I'm **David Gay**, a **humanitarian free software** hacker.

I'm a part of the RIT Lab for Technological Literacy, or **the FOSSBox**.

I'm a **Red Hat** intern on the **Fedora Engineering Team**.

In a year, I'll complete my BS in **Information Technology** from **RIT**.

Gamification
============

Last year, I completed a summer research fellowship where a team of four game
design students and I explored the idea of a Fedora RPG.

**Fedora Badges is different.**

Our system doesn't wrap the Fedora Project in a game system, but instead seeks
to **recognize** participation and contributions to Fedora by awarding
**virtual badges**.

Fedora Badges is a recognition system, not gamification.
