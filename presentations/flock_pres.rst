It recognizes participation and contributions to Fedora by awarding
**virtual badges**.

The Open Badges Infrastructure
==============================

**Mozilla Open Badges** was launched in September 2011 to issue digital badges
to recognize skills and achievements.

The Open Badges Infrastructure defines a badge as a JSON blob containing
some metadata at a particular URL.

Open badges themselves can also be PNG files with **"baked-in" metadata**.

A badge contains:

-   a **title**.

-   a **description**.

-   an **image**.

-   a link to badge **criteria**.

----

The Stack
=========

Fedora Badges makes use of 5 core pieces of Fedora infrastructure software.

Badges For Everyone!
====================

We don't want to keep badges to contributors.

In the future, **regular Fedora users** will be able to earn badges during
their use of the operating system.

**Desktop notifications** can tell you when you've earned a badge, and clicking
them can take you to the Badges web interface.

Users will be able to offer their own **community badges** to others, like the
"You made <user>'s day!" badge.
