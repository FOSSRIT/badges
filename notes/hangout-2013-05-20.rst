Google Hangout #1
=================

Date: 2013 May 20

Thanks to Remy DeCausemaker for providing me with his notes
which I used to create these notes. :)

Current Structure of Project
----------------------------

Wiki page: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Open_Badges

Backend
    plugins, award badges based on fedmsgs

Frontend
    Tahrir web app, UI needs to be improved for users, should
    look into Fedora style guidelines

We should develop a web interface along with the backend to help
guide development. It will also be a good way to show progress
by displaying data we've gathered. Let's get to where we can easily
award a badge, and then add metrics and analytics.

Task List
---------

-   YAML/trigger stuff related to auto-awarding of badges

-   Make sure to be aware of the same badge awarded to one user at
    multiple emails (for metrics)

-   Configurable salt for MD5 hashes

-   Create intro email with badges survey [oddshocks]

-   Local datanommer with postgres dump [oddshocks]

-   Webapp UI [oddshocks]

-   Award badges via QR code [threebean]

-   Review Fedora style guide and create badges style guide [JennX]

-   Different borders/colors/styles for different types of badges
    (design, code, community, event, etc) [JennX]

-   Meta-achievements and unawardable badge for getting all badges
    ("Apotheosis")

Sugar
#####

These are Sugar-related tasks not directly connected to my Red Hat
internship.

-   Tahrir on XO/SchoolServer

-   Accept outside badges?

-   Hook into machine activity in a non-creepy way

    -   System-tap talks with systemd

    -   ABRT does anonymous submissions for user activity
