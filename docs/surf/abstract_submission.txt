The goal of the Fedbadges ("Federated Badges") project is to provide a general
purpose software stack for awarding Mozilla Open Badges (http://openbadges.org)
to project contributors.

By fixing bugs, writing documentation, contributing media assets, managing
systems, packaging software, and participating in the community, folks are
programmatically awarded virtual badges that they can display all over the
Internet. 

The focus of my internship has been developing Tahrir -- a Free-as-in-Freedom
Python-powered Pyramid web application responsible for displaying, managing,
and sharing these badges -- and deploying it for use within the Fedora Project
(http://fedoraproject.org).

The poster and presentation will show the architecture of the software stack,
and provide examples of interfaces and art assets used in Tahrir.
