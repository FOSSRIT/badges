About Me
========

I'm **David Gay**, a **humanitarian free software** hacker.

I'm a part of the RIT Lab for Technological Literacy, or **the FOSSBox**.

I'm a **Red Hat** intern on the **Fedora Engineering Team**.

In a year, I'll complete my BS in **Information Technology** from **RIT**.

----

Gamification
============

Last year, I completed a summer research fellowship where a team of four game
design students and I explored the idea of a Fedora RPG.

**Fedora Badges is different.**

Our system doesn't wrap the Fedora Project in a game system, but instead seeks
to **recognize** participation and contributions to Fedora by awarding
**virtual badges**.

Fedora Badges is a recognition system, **not gamification**.

----

Open Badges
===========

**Mozilla Open Badges** was launched in September 2011 to issue digital badges
to recognize skills and achievements.

Open badges themselves are PNG files with **"baked-in" metadata** in the form
of a JSON blob.

A badge contains:

-   a **title**.

-   a **description**.

-   an **image**.

-   a link to badge **criteria**.

Badge Issuers
=============

Anyone can issue Open Badges.

Already awarding badges:

Mozilla claims that PBS, P2PU, Intel, and the US Department of Education

Badges from all sources can be exported to your **Mozilla Backpack**
at http://beta.openbadges.org and displayed all over the web.
