Fedora Badges isn't gamification, it's a recognition system.

It recognizes participation and contributions to Fedora by awarding
**virtual badges**.

----

We want Fedora contributors to earn badges.

Award topics include:

-   Ask Fedora.

-   Fedora Wiki edits.

-   FAS.

-   IRC meetings.

-   Bodhi updates, testing and stable.

-   Bodhi tests and karma.

-   Koji builds.

-   Fedora Planet posts.

-   group membership, like sponsors.

-   Fedora Tagger.

-   commits to Fedora package repositories.

-   community-awarded badges.

-   event attendance... like Flock 2013. :)

The Open Badges Infrastructure
==============================

**Mozilla Open Badges** was launched in September 2011 to issue digital badges
to recognize skills and achievements.

The Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) defines a badge as a JSON blob containing
some metadata at a particular URL.

Open badges are defined by a JSON blob, which can be baked-in to the badge
PNG, if so desired.

A badge is:

-   a **title**.

-   a **description**.

-   an **image**.

-   a link to badge **criteria**.

----

Badges are awarded by creating an **assertion**.

Assertions associate a badge with an email address.

Assertions are JSON blobs which live at cryptic web addresses.
The validity of a badge award can be checked by confirming that
an appropriate JSON blob lives at the URL for that assertion.

----

Anyone can issue Open Badges.

Already awarding badges:

-   NASA

-   Disney-Pixar

-   4H

-   DigitalMe

-   TotaraLMS

-   Moodle

Mozilla claims that PBS, P2PU, Intel, and the US Department of Education
are soon to follow.

----

Badges from all sources can be exported to your **Mozilla Backpack**
at http://beta.openbadges.org and displayed all over the web.

Backpacks are decentralized. Fedora Badges is technically a backpack.
Badges can be exported between any backpack. Mozilla's service is
simply the original one. It provides a clean interface and
useful widgets for displaying your badges on a website.

----

The Stack
=========

Fedora Badges makes use of 5 core pieces of Fedora infrastructure software.

Badges For Everyone!
====================

We don't want to keep badges to contributors.

In the future, **regular Fedora users** will be able to earn badges during
their use of the operating system.

**Desktop notifications** can tell you when you've earned a badge, and clicking
them can take you to the Badges web interface.

Users will be able to offer their own **community badges** to others, like the
"You made <user>'s day!" badge.
